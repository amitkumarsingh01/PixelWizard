                <h6>Why Mentorship Matters</h6>
                <p>
                    Mentorship is a powerful way to enhance learning, gain insights, and accelerate career development. Through one-on-one sessions with experienced faculty, students can ask questions, seek advice, and gain invaluable knowledge that goes beyond the classroom.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our mentorship platform is designed to foster meaningful interactions between faculty and students, helping you gain clarity on your academic path, sharpen your skills, and prepare for the future.
